# Music-Genre-Classification
This project involves the application of several prediction models that make music genre classifications given a training set of music features and their corresponding genre labels. Done through Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other Python libraries such as Matplotlib. The actual categorization will actually only be ‘Rock’ or ‘Not Rock’ for this project. Further explanation is provided in our project report document.
