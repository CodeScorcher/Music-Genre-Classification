# Music-Genre-Classification
This project involves the application of several prediction models that make music genre classifications given a training set of music features and their corresponding genre labels. Done through Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other Python libraries such Matplotlib. 

### Description:
The project takes various column details such as artist name, energy, loudness, etc. and places them into different “classes”. The “classes” consists of many genres such as Rock, Alt, Pop, and more. By analyzing the data, we will categorize them as accurately as possible. (The actual categorization will actually only be ‘Rock’ or ‘Not Rock’ for this project. Further explanation is provided in our project report document)
